#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)

The runtime is logarthermic  O(log n) since the the n is multipield by itself example is a=a+(n*n)

b)

due to the 2 loops  it will run  at n 0(n^2) runtime.


c) 

is a recurisve function and as n increases so will the function calls therefore it is O(n)

## Exercise II


I would let the min = less than the floor f 
set max = the floor or higher
guess the average of max and min 
set the min to be larger than the guess
if the egg cracked that means in the max floor is too large and would need to be set to decrement than the guess. This would run at log2n just like binary search
